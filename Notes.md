# Notes

## Scanning laser
- ~5mW red laser is just barely visible to cam with 10us exposure.
- 50mW blue laser is probably enough.
- Will need to take extra care when pointing this laser at calib cam. (Possibly use tail end of switch off for weaker beam).

- 30 FPS at 20mm/s = 670um per frame.


- 5W camera light source is not enough power. Need maybe 10x?
- Going for 30W LED light source.
